We have a baseline presentable "site" primordial, an it looks decent, especially with the update to ui1. There are definitely things to add, little spiffies here and there. I want to discuss the hurdles and challenges associated with bringing the company to full service. The main innovations beyond the dome designs themselves is really considering the development of the JIT pellet to filament extrusion system. ChatGPT agrees with me upon the potential advantages of the system, but I think we'll put that out there and allow others to work with us, in a kind of community open source way, bring about the conceptual designs. So between finishing the dome's initial designs and the JIT concepts, we'll continue to conceptualize how we'll get from a to b in terms of bringing Relokida to a full service state.

Lastly, and more down the road is the full self reliance of water collection via atmospheric water generators. For now it's more of a dream on top of the dream of even building the dome structures.

So the first two are more pressing, and we'll continue to develop for both. But I think with the right community, and projects we'll bring Relokida to a serviceable state.

So those will be our main objectives in the process of developing the service. Of course we can continue to elaborate what we're doing, and build a KS page to further help us elucidate the costs, and what we actually need funding wise to bring Relokida to it's full service state. I feel like it really will occur in steps and needs further consideration and truly pragmatic and physical testing before we can even move forward.

So - baseline designs of the helium series dome, and the conceptualization of the JIT jk1 pellet to filament extrusion system, lastly is further presentation, visualization, inspiration, renderings of how and what the domes could look like. 
__
It's really shaping up, so lastly will be an invite to the discord community, talk about the hurdles and obstacles associated and update ui1 to use our most advanced layout system.
__
More interactables too, would make it interesting. Objects they can rotate around, look at from all angles.
__
Maybe three good photos or gifs, or short video formats to fly them around the dome, and see the basic interior. Then we can jump into the FAQ section, and then funnel to the crowd source and community.
__
We'll build the relokida primordial landing to the point of being, entirely ready, well thought out, thorough, and then just at the point of selling, we'll channel people to the crowd sourcing endeavour. 
__
So the plan is for the landing is to of course make it more, engaging, and interactable, visually understandable, appealing. I'd like several shots demonstrating how the pieces fit together, from the frames and clips, to the panels and then the whole dome system.

Then of course I was the "main" grabber visual to be a video, that takes a viewer through the whole dome process, starting with a nice beauty shot, and then taking them through the manufacturing process, the assembling, and showing how it can be done by hand, by an individual(s).

Then more beauty shots, environmental models shots, 

Then for the community invite, a shot of a frame composition on a wooden table would look neat.

I'm glad that we're envisioning the primordial landing. We'll continue to consider the service, but so far as the model offerings I feel like we're making serious strides. We still have to consider the interiors and the center utility hub, and wall partitions.

So of course the landing will demonstrate the best features of the dwellings, in a conscise way, repreresnt how the service works and briefly list the "dwelling styles" Selo, Omaka and Abba.

Then a page that describe in more detail the Selo, Omaka and the Abba.

So landing will consist of:

- eye catching visuals
- explanation of how the domes are constructed
__
See dwelling options
__
Main Landing:

So of course the title "Relokida" at the top left.

Then I'd like a video that plays without user intervention that shows all the enticing features and eye catching elements of the domes, how it's constructed, framing, endoskeleton.

Below that, a summation of Relokida, dwelling systems aligned with nature etc.

Below that, maybe another video element demonstrating how it's printed, how the parts fit together. Then another short summation of that process. Designed, printed, assembled.

Then three images "beauty shots" of the domes, in natural environment renders,

Below that a top view and with a sub header, "see our models".

Below that will be a shot of the community of Relokida, and a list of socials to connect, maybe just one main social. And a link to the project location github.

Models List:

So a simple image and sub header listing the Omaka, Selo and Abba.

Another format could be, one where, rather than listing the individual "models", we could have configurations, fitted for dwelling styles, make it that much easier for people to choose the type of offering. Studio, or single family home,

Yeah, so that's a better option, is giving them, type of living styles and then a preassembled dwelling to fit the need rather than being like "here you go" with the parts. The easier we can make it the better.

Model:

An image of the model, followed by sub header description, specifications.

Below that, a 3d render they can move around, look at from all angles.

We'll use the farm.bot landing page as our template, to gather ideas on the best present the models, provide interactable examples. We can use this site as a means of then transferring it over to other presentables.
